Kiwi Menu replaces the Activities button with a compact, macOS-inspired launcher that keeps your most common session actions one click away.

## Features

- **macOS-style panel button**: Swaps the Activities label for a tidy icon-only trigger that blends into GNOME Shell.
- **Curated session controls**: Sleep, restart, shut down, lock, and log out entries mirror the macOS Apple menu workflow.
- **Recent items submenu**: Hover or click to browse recent files and folders with automatic section headers and quick launch support.
- **Force Quit overlay**: Launches the built-in xkill helper from the menu when an app misbehaves. Optionaly, can also close all apps in current workspace.
- **Adaptive logout label**: Personalizes the log out entry with your full name when available.
- **Hide Activities**: Hide activities button in top panel.
- **Hide Power buttons**: Hide Lock screen and Power buttons in Quick Settings
- **Multilingual support**: Fully translatable interface
